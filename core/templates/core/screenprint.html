<h1>About the screenprinting project</h1>
<p>In the Screenprinting Project for our New Media and Technology class, we were tasked with designing and building screens to print. We had to create a design focused on a real-world issue. Then, we had to build frames, add the screen, and the stencil to them, to create the screens we would use to print our design onto a piece of paper, fabric, and cardboard. Additionally, our designs had to include a real-life photo of ourselves, whether that be a whole-body photo, or just a hand.</p>

<h1>Step 1:Designing</h1>
<p>For my design specifically, I decided to focus on an important issue in the world right now, climate change. I included an Earth on fire in my design, as well as a and reaching out to touch it to add a more human aspect.  I think I was inspired a bit by Banksy’s work, which we looked at and analyzed in class. I wanted to spread an important message to the world, that we need to change to save our planet. </p>

<h1>Step 2:Photography</h1>
<p>I think this was one of my favorite parts of the project. Ever since I was a baby, I have loved taking pictures. We had to take pictures of ourselves for our designs, and for me that was a photo of my hand. I think this was a pretty easy shot to take, because I got a pretty good result in the first try. My teammates and I helped each other find the perfect aperture and shutter speed. For my design in specific, this was a 1/25 shutter speed, F5.6 aperture. I enjoyed taking these photos with my teammates as well as with my friends, it was nice to help each other out. </p>

<h1>Step 3:Using Photoshop</h1>
<p>Next, we had to edit our photos and create our printing designs on photoshop. This meant removing backgrounds, adding paint/drawing designs, and cutting out parts we didn’t want. This was also where we included our quote. After searching for quotes regarding climate change, I decided to use “The climate is changing, so why won’t we?”. We then added our quotes to our designs. I added the earth and fire in photoshop. I initially wanted to include a photo of the earth on fire. But, I ended up having to use the drawing tool as our designs could only use up to 3 colors (each color = 1 frame, so too many colors would be way too much). I enjoyed this step as well, as I found finding brushes and specific colors to use to be fun. </p>

<h1>Step 4: Building the Screens and Printing</h1>
<p>Finally, we had build the screens. I found this to be the hardest part. There were a lot of aspects to think about, and since I had 3 colors, which was a lot, I had to build 3 frames. We started out by fiinding the sizes for the wood that we need to cut based on the size of our design. After, we had to cut the wood pieces one by one, and glue each of those pieces together to make the frames. In my case, I needed to make 3 frames, and each frame required 4 cut pieces of wood, so I needed to make 12 pieces. After nailing and glueing the frames together, we had to add the screens. This was a hard part, we had to have one person hold the screen down on the frame and the other nail. Both took a lot of strength, and it was hard to coordinate. Once our screens tightly covered the frame, we printed out our designs on vinyl, weeding out the excess vinyl to make our stencil. We were then to iron these onto our screens, and take the peel off. After adding tape all around, we were ready to print.</p>

</div>

<p>This was where I think I could’ve used the most improvement - the painting. I had 3 colors, so there were a lot of prints to do, and I had to wait for each layer of paint to dry before I could safely do the next, ending in a waste of working time. I did end up changing the color of a part of my design. The text and my hand were initially brown, but I ended up changing this to green match the Earthy theme. I decided to print on blue fabric, after practicing my prints on paper of course. This did end well. When I did the last print, my fire on the fabric, I found that my practice looked better than the attempt I made on the final. To solve this, I got the idea to cut this part out and sew it onto my final. It ended up adding a cool effect to my final result, an interesting pop of color. While this did end well, I think my prints on the box and paper could’ve ended better. I had a really hard time aligning each print because there were so many layers to print. </p>

<h1>Looking Back</h1>
<p>In retrospect, I think this was a very enjoyable project in this class. I love art and design, so it was fun taking photos, painting, and designing our screens. This project did require a lot of teamwork, so I am lucky to have been able to work with my teammates in the building process to help me make my screens, take photos, and give me feedback.</p>

<h1>21st Century Skills</h1>
<p>I think one of the foremost skills I demonstrated in this project was critical thinking and problem solving. I ran into a lot of problems, like not being able to follow my initial design plan, having too many screens, and so much more. But I came up with ideas in every step to solve these problems. When I realized I wouldn’t be able to use the initial plan I had for my design, I changed it in prototype. When I felt that my final didn’t turn out so good, I came up with the idea of attaching a print that came out well onto my final. Building and designing is a process that involves a lot of trial and error, so I think this is where I spent the most of my time, problem solving. </p>
